        <img class="bruh" src="bruh.png" alt="">
        <p>Recycled Rags was created during the pandemic. It started as our hobby selling popular brands of clothes among skaters in Baguio.
            Earning a little cash that will feed us for the day.

           After a few months, the group decided to make it a business. They came up with the name and the logo, 
           and we created our social media business in May 2020. We were selling popular brands like Adidas, Vans, etc.
            A few months later, in 2021, we discovered fashion and decided to invest in vintage, archive pieces, and luxury brands. 
            Over the years, our business and group kept growing.
